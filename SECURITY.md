# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability, exposed credential, or exploit technique. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository:

`https://github.com/CaixyPromise/seven-framework/security/advisories/new`

Include the affected version, reproducible steps, impact, and any proposed mitigation. Do not include production credentials, personal data, or data copied from systems you do not own.

## Disclosure process

Maintainers will acknowledge a valid report, assess affected versions, coordinate a fix, and publish an advisory after supported releases are available. Public disclosure should be coordinated so operators have a reasonable upgrade window.

## Credential handling

Never commit real database DSNs, API tokens, private keys, third-party application credentials, environment files, database exports, uploads, or production topology. Example configuration must contain empty values or documented placeholders only. Rotate any credential that has entered Git history; deleting it from the latest commit is not sufficient.

## Dependency scan policy

CI and release packaging run `govulncheck` and fail for every reachable finding except two explicitly reviewed upstream Moby findings: `GO-2026-4883` and `GO-2026-4887`. Those advisories concern Moby daemon plugin privilege and authorization validation. Seven Framework imports the Docker API client and does not embed or run the affected daemon-side validation paths. The current stable `github.com/docker/docker` module has no fixed release for either advisory, so this exception is intentionally narrow, visible in `scripts/check-go-vulnerabilities.sh`, and must be re-evaluated whenever the Docker dependency changes. Any additional reachable finding fails the build.
